# NOTE
I am not actively developing this package any longer, as:
- A different package by the same name and doing the same thing is already published on CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/processR/index.html 
- There's been enough literature written on the issues with the Preacher and Hayes approach that I don't find it particularly useful anymore. See the review section here: https://doi.org/10.1080/00273171.2019.1656051

# processr
R implementation for the PROCESS macro; please read the introduction, which is posted on RPubs: http://rpubs.com/markhw/processr

Still under development. Install using the `devtools` package:

`devtools::install_github("markhwhiteii/processr")`
